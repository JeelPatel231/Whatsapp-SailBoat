# SailBoat userbot project



```
/**
    Your Whatsapp account may get banned.
    I am not responsible for any improper use of this bot
    This bot is intended for the purpose of having fun with memes,
    and doing stuff in the chats itself to make life easier.
    You ended up spamming groups, getting reported left and right,
    and you ended up in a dogfight with Whatsapp and at the end
    WhatsApp bans your account?
    And after that, then you pointed your fingers at us
    for getting your account deleted?
    I will be rolling on the floor laughing at you.

## What is it?

SailBoat is a modular WhatsApp userbot running on Python3.
Simply uses selenium automation.

Inspired from many Telegram-Userbots, I am making this one for WhatsApp.

## How do I use it?

YOU DON'T, not yet atleast.
